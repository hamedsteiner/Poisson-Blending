# Poisson-Blending
Poisson image blending in MATLAB


## Getting Started

Poisson Blending is implemented with sparse matrix to solve the linear equation (Ax=b). It can
handle gray or RGB image by recursive method. 

Gradient-domain image processing is a simple technique applicable to blending, tone-mapping, and non-photorealistic rendering. In this assignment, we will use gradient-domain blending for seamless image compositing; so-called Poisson blending because in the process of compositing we will solve a kind of second-order partial differential equation commonly known as Poisson's equation (after Sim√©on Denis Poisson).

### Run
Select background and target images, in main.m(input directory), then run main.m
